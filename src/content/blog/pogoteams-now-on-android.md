PoGoTeams is officially available on Android. If you've been waiting for a Google Play release, it's here.

Everything from the iOS version is included: automatic team building, lead gameplans, matchup analysis, battle log with trend detection, and team grades. Same features, same data.

The app is free with an optional one-time purchase to remove ads.

[Get it on Google Play](https://pogoteams.app/android.html)

Already on iOS? Nothing changes for you. Both platforms stay in sync with the same rankings and data updates.
