Blog serves three purposes: SEO, technical help/documentation, and demonstrating active development.

## Published

- [x] **Custom Movesets: Build Teams Around the Moves You Actually Run** (Feb 21) - feature guide + how-to

## To write

### Backdated

- [ ] **PoGoTeams Is Now on Android** (~Feb 11) - short announcement, cross-platform, link to Google Play. Matches the Reddit post timing.

### Feature guides / help content (evergreen SEO)

- [ ] **How Automatic Team Building Works** - how the algorithm picks teams, what affects scores, what the numbers mean. Core feature deserves a thorough post.
- [ ] **Lead Gameplans Explained** - how to read shield scenarios, when to stay/switch. People google "pokemon go pvp lead strategy".
- [ ] **Using the Battle Log to Counter Your Meta** - logging battles, how trends influence team building, corebreakers. Answers "how to beat my opponents".
- [ ] **Team Grades: What Coverage, Bulk, Safety, and Consistency Mean** - short explainer of the four metrics. Users will google this after seeing grades in the app.

### Future (after releases)

- [ ] **Real-time battle assistant** - biggest launch post, detailed guide
